# Note-Taker

## What is the Note-Taker project about?

We were given starter code that we needed to modify in order to get the back-end to connect to the front-end.  The user should able to save multiple notes and store them on the wesbite.  The user should also have the ability to delete the notes when they are done.

## Installation
